Recognition of Biological Cell Organs through Computer Vision
============================================================

This project is a part of STEM week. The goal of this project is to recognize the biological cell organs through computer vision. The project is divided into two parts: the first part is to recognize the cell organs through the image and the second part is to recognize the cell organs through the video. The project is implemented in Python using OpenCV.

## Implementation

First iteration was implemented in Python using OpenCV.

In the second iteration, the project is rewritten in JavaScript using OpenCV.js, to make it accessible through the web browser.

## Cell types to be recognized

- Animal cell
- Plant cell
- Bacterial cell
- Fungal cell
